## Mod 2 Deliverables:
* Written reflection:
  * How you've used agile as a process at Turing and what kind of project management tools you utilized. Address these questions:

    * What were you already doing?
    
Most of my projects already used a style similar to agile. We would take the project, look at what needed to get done, break it into it's smallest parts, and make a to-do list out of those tasks. Usually we use some kind of organization software like trello or waffle. Just like agile, we would take out a single piece of the to-do list, and make a commit. Every day we touch base with what we've done, what we're struggling with, and what we still have to do. In small projects like the ones we had in mod 1 it just seemed natural to divide the work that way and develop an agile work style.
    
    * What did you put into place in Module Two?
    
Module 2 was a lot of the same as mod 1, I find the easiest way to tackle a project, no matter the size, is to break it into it's smallest parts and chip away at it little by little. When I was working on Game Time, Kailin took on the biggest task of reorganizing our index.js and game.js file. We initially wrote it all on one page so fixing that was a huge task. To make sure our work didn't come to a standstill I checked in with her very often and kept pushing up the smaller projects that I worked on.    

    * What was effective?
    
Using waffle.io was the most effective thing we've done. It helps us keep track of all the small parts of our project so nothing gets lost. Humans have finite memories, that's why we rely on computers to keep track of our progress for us.   
   
    * What do you want to improve on in future projects?
    
In future projects I want to get better with my refactoring. I need to work on finding ways to clean up my code. Right now I am at a point where I don't have a full grasp of all of the tools in my belt in terms of making code as clean as possible, but as I work, and as I learn more, refactoring will become easier. And, ideally, my code will be cleaner the first time.
    
  * Description of the role you played in your pair/group projects this module -- what was your role as a teammate? How did you utilize your strengths and leadership skills?
  
My role as a teammate in my projects was just that, a teammate. I make sure, that as a team member I take care of all of the tasks assigned to me, whether I choose them myself or someone gives them to me. I think it is vital to have my work taken care of that way I can lend support to the rest of my team. I found that my teammates know that I'm someone they can turn to when they have questions. I want them to feel that way because I like to help them and solve problems. I also know that if I'm ever stuck they'll be happy to return the favor.
  
* Feedback II reflection: In-person feedback conversation following these [guidelines](https://github.com/turingschool/career-development-curriculum/blob/master/module_two/feedback_conversation_reflection_guidelines.md)

  * Date of feedback conversation: 
12/08/2017

  * How did you prepare for the conversation? 

During the project, usually after long sessions of work or at the end of the day we would discuss how the day went and how we were both feeling about the project and each other. So I took into account all of those conversations along with reflecting on how I thought the project went in the end.

  * How did the conversation go for you? What was easy about the conversation? What was more difficult? 

I thought the conversation went very well. Our whole project went smoothly. Our conversation about the project went just as smoothly, we both feel we worked hard and made amazing progress. Discussing all the things that went well in the project were easy to talk about because we were reveling in our victories. The most difficult thing to talk about was the coaching. We acknowledged that we both have more to learn, but we understand that as students, that's exactly why we're here.

  * What principles of feedback did you use in the conversation? 

We used positive feedback, acknowledgement of our successes, and coaching.
